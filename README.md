# LDNI-based-Solid-Modeling

This project provides a set of solid modeling tools which aims to help processing 3D objects with complex topology and geometry that are widely used in many industrial applications (e.g., microstructure design and manufacturing, biomedical products and applications, jewelry products, reverse engineering).

The system is completely GPU-based and heavily based on an implicit representation named LDNI.

Features
- Boolean Operations
- Offset
- Scaffold
- Super Union
- 3D Printing
